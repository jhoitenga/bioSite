        Learning about Ancient History such as the first cultures in Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, the Pyramids in Giza, and Celtic tribes. Taking an interest in ancient history helps us understand where we are from and what we are trying to accomplish, and it gives us a better understanding of how our own actions in the current time can be compared with the ancients' attempts to shape their futures. Ancient history spans over several countries, continents, and centuries so it never gets boring.
